This is a Discord Bot. 

It starts by signing one player every hour with =sign command

Players are added or removed from the main 11 players using =starters add playerID or =starters rm playerID

The name of the team can be set with =name NewName

The players in the club can be viewed with the =club command

Your main 11 can be viewed with =team

you can play others using =friendly DiscordHandle

Players can be sold with =sell playerID

Balance can be checked with =balance

The bot uses the FIFA 21 players and ratings

Winners are determined using the base stats and a random range to give every one a chance. 

this is a very rough first version, bugs can be expected.

It's based on SoccerGuru bot, just to see what it takes to build something like that

Current commands:

=sign

=starters add playerID

=starters rm playerID
=name NewName

=club

=team

=friendly DiscordHandle

=sell playerID

=balance
